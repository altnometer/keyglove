* Project Overview

A brief description of your keyboard:
- what makes it unique (e.g., ergonomic, wireless, THIRD-printed case).
- Target audience (e.g., writers, coders, gamers, etc).
- Tools required (soldering tools, THIRD printer, etc).

* Features

** Layout

minimal, ergonomic, ortholinear, split, etc

** Switches

Your preferred switches, e.g.,
- Cherry MX Blue,
- Gateron Brown,
- etc

** Connectivity

USB

** Case Material

3D-printed,
Tried only:
- PEG type plastics for durability and strength

* Parts List

There are 36 keys in this keyboard. Hence, for things like
- key switches
- keycaps
- diods
- etc
You will need at least 36 pieces of each. Make sure you have some
spare ones as well.

** 3D-Printed Case

Start by printing the cases from provided STL files. If you wish to
adjust the key positions, use the scripts (TODO: link) to create
modified cases (for right and left hands).



** Microcontroller

Quantity: 2

** Key Switches

1. key switches, e.g.,  Gateron Browns, Plus a few spare ones
2. Different keys for finger keys (e.g., Gateron Brown) and thumb keys
   (used mainly for layer switching), e.g., Kailh Silver, linear, with
   shorter activation levels, with added key rings to minimize time,
   distance traveled for faster responses.

** Keycaps

DSA key caps. Please, be advise, you will need to grind off some of
the keycaps to fit them. Hence, make sure you have some spare keycaps.

** Diodes

quality diodes.

** 4 pole 3.5mm trrs audio jack socket

Make sure it is of trrs type (not yrs).

For example:

** other parts

TODO: make their own sections

4 pole 3.5mm trrs audio jack cable

USB type A (largest USB connectors for durability).
- socket
- cable


** soldering wire

* Build Process

** Prepare the Case

Print the case from the =3d_prints= directory. Ensure that surfaces for
the key switches are even and smooth. Sand and finish to your liking.

** Assemble Components

- Glue the switches section and hand rest section together.
- find the best location for the palm rest section (location for the right and left
  hands may differ).

Mount switches:
- ensure consistent orientation
Mount other components
- USB socket
- trrs socket
  + connect right and left hand parts
  + !!! Never disconnect right and left parts while the keyboard is
    powered.
- TODO: complete list

There is not specific holder for the micro controller.


** Solder Switches and Diodes

*** Wiring and Soldering

TODO: add images of wiring

Maybe (not likely) wiring schematic on or Fritzing diagram.

**** switches and diodes

**** 4 pole 3.5mm trrs audio jack socket

Insert, then solder.

!!! Pull up resistor (include resistor specs).

**** USB type A

Insert, then solder.

There is a rudimentary holder for the socket. You may need to cut the
place holder to size. Just use the soldering iron to melt it to size.
Glue for greater strength.



* QMK Firmware Setup

** Flashing the Micro controller:

** Customize keymaps using QMK

* Usage

Ensure your elbow are the same level as the wrists.

- Connect via USB or Bluetooth

* Customazation

- Print out,
- assemble switches and caps,
- find your own location for the palm rest.
- try out:
  + keep checking the fit for a weak or two (it is better to let your
    hand adjust a little rather than adjusting the key locations for a
    new cycle)
- when made your mind, either
  + solder the keys and complete your fully functional keyboard
  OR
  + adjust the settings in the scripts (TODO: link) to modify the key
    locations.

- Modify the case design in =cad_models/=

* Contributing

The repository is not under any active maintenance. It is simple
enough. No need for complexity. When you find your best fit, give it a
year or two to drive test. You may just enjoy easier, more productive
interacting with a computer after.

Consider migrating the scripts to open source software (solutions).

1. Fork the repository.
2. Submit a PR with clear changes.
