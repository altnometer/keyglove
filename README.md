This repository contains:
- Fusion API scripts which generate 3D model parts that can be used to
  assemble an ergonomic computer keyboard.
- STL files for printing a prototype of the keyboard.
  - Please be aware that the prototype version does not matches the
    latest script settings. You will need to wait a couple of months
    for the first tagged version which will match the scripts
    settings. From that point, you will be able to adjust the scripts
    and print out parts for your own preferences.

You can get a free hobbyist/learner license from Autodesk and try out
these scripts in Fusion platform for 3D CAD (Computer-Aided
Design).
